plotnetcfg is a tool that scans networking configuration on the machine and
plots a diagram of the configuration hierarchy.

Design goals are:
1. Lighweight. It should have no run time dependencies. Just scp the
   binary to the target machine.
2. Works across net namespaces.
3. Allows multiple frontends. (Right now, only graphviz fronted is
   implemented.)


Example usage:

ssh target_machine plotnetcfg | dot -Tpdf > output.pdf


Building:

libnetlink static library from iproute2 is needed. Look for a package named
iproute-devel or similar.


Bugs:

Report bugs to jbenc@redhat.com. Patches are welcome.
